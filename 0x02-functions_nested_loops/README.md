## `5. Sign`
* [5-sign.c](./5-sign.c):
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
## `6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you`
* [6-abs.c](./6-abs.c):
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
## `7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important`
* [7-print_last_digit.c](./7-print_last_digit.c):
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
## `8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life`
* [8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c):
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
## `9. Learn your times table`
* [9-times_table.c](./9-times_table.c):
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
## `10. a + b`
* [10-add.c](./10-add.c):
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
## `11. Holberton School, 98 Battery Street, San Francisco CA 94111`
* [11-print_to_98.c](./11-print_to_98.c):
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
## `12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself`
* [100-times_table.c](./100-times_table.c):
Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
## `13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women`
* [101-natural.c](./101-natural.c):
Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women
## `14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A`
* [102-fibonacci.c](./102-fibonacci.c):
Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
## `15. Even Liber Abbaci`
* [103-fibonacci.c](./103-fibonacci.c):
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
## `16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+`
