---------

**What you'll learn**:

-   Discuss what the cloud is and why it’s a technological and business game changer.

-   Describe the different ways a user can interact with Google Cloud.

-   Discover the different compute options in Google Cloud.



Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/kBB3D033ty5y5-MtUyV3Hw "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   Cloud Computing is revolutionizing today’s world. It affects the way we communicate, do business, interact with everyday things and one another. This course discusses the fundamental theoretical and practical applications of Cloud Computing. It provides the basic concepts to understand why cloud computing is and will be such an important part of future jobs and businesses. It focuses on Google Cloud’s extended solutions and compute options.



Requirements
------------

### General

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-   You are not allowed to use global variables
-   No more than 5 functions per file
-   The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc... is forbidden
-   Allowed syscalls: `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`
-   You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c "_putchar")
-   You don't have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won't be taken into account
-   In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
-   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
-   Don't forget to push your header file
-   All your header files should be include guarded
-   Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (`POSIX`) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance `read(STDIN_FILENO, ...` vs `read(0, ...`
